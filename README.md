# nlip_client-ts
The React/Typescript application serves as a frontend that uses NLIP to interact with the NLIP backend. It supports both textual and binary input (e.g., images) and converts user inputs into a structured NLIP message format before forwarding them to the backend and subsequently receiving a response.
